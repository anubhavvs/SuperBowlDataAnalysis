# SuperBowlDataAnalysis

A Data Analysis project with Python using the Super Bowl Data. I have tried to make a project with the statistics from each game, TV viewership and also half time musicians. We're going to answer questions like:<br />

* What are the most extreme game outcomes?<br />
* How does the game affect television viewership?<bvr />
* How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?<br />
* Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?<br />
